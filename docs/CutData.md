# Suggestions on what data to cut
This is a compilation of what to remove in step 2 of visual inspection.

Since this is an "arbitrary" process, it is important that you don't introduce systematic bias, for example cleaning seperately conditions you later compare, especially if you have reason to believe they might have different levels of noise.
It's also best if you don't know what file you're cleaning each time.

The goals to keep in mind are, in order:
1. Remove anything that would mask data
2. Preserve as much data as possible
3. Have the data as clean as possible

The most important thing is that nothing is left in the recording that directly affects your outcome measures of real brain signal. This is very much a "you know it when you see it" type of artifact. Point 2 is about going to the effort of salvaging data in the middle of noise. Point 3 counteracts to some extent point 2, but has to take a back seat if you're cleaning too heavily. 

The criteria in order of importance when deciding what to remove or not:
1. **How big is it?** If the occurance involves crazy high amplitudes relative to the rest of the signal, it needs removing.
2. **Does it have any signal left in it?** If the noise is such that you can't see any underlying EEG, then it should be removed, no doubt.
3. **Could it mask important EEG effects?** If the noise has similar properties to the type of analysis you'll be doing, such as a certain spectrum (1-40Hz), you'll want to get rid of it if you're sure that it's not infact generated by the brain.
4. **Does it clearly look un-physiological?** If the noise is clearly not data, like periodic spikes, it makes sense to remove them.
5. **Does it clearly not come from the brain?** This especially applies to muscle artefacts; if you're confident it's not some high-frequency beta burst, but rather muscle activity, I would remove it. 


When NOT to remove some data:
1. **It's possibly brain data**: don't remove anything that is plausably generated by the brain, and only by the brain. Err on the side of caution if you're uncertain, and leave it in.
2. **It can be removed with ICA**: don't remove anything that you know will go away with ICA, namely eye movements (blinks, saccades, rolling eye movements) and heartbeat. Vice versa, if you know something can't be properly removed with ICA (like single-occurance events, or high-frequency bursts), it's a good reason to cut it out. 
3. **The discontinuity is more detrimental than the noise**: if an artefact is small, selecting it as a segment to be removed can create more of an artefact from "edge artifacts", for example in power calculations or ERPs.
4. **Too much data has been removed, and it's not too bad**. This applies when you have a lot of worse noise in the file, and this timepoint/channel still preserves a reasonable amount of signal. It's a judgement call, because the alternative would be to not include the file at all, and some statistics really don't like that, and if you have a low n (e.g. clinical data), you often can't afford to be too picky. In practice, I've had this happen with a) mild muscle activity when many other channels had a lot of high muscle activity b) low amplitude low frequency irregular fluctuations in most channels. 

What counts as too much data being removed? I don't actually know. With 128 channels, there's a lot of redundant information in neighboring channels, and so interpolation (last preprocessing step) recovers essentially all the relevant EEG, especially for <12hz information. This process works less well when the channels being removed are on the periphery, but these also tend to contain less brain data in general. My personal criterion was whether the remaining channels/timepoints still captured visible EEG events in more than 1 channel (and again anything that would be removed with ICA).

Recommendation: if there are channels that are removed in a majority of datasets, jut remove them in all of the datasets.

Important: be consistent. If multiple people are cleaning the data, either have one person check the rest, or have each person handle a whole participant; don't introduce bias across conditions or groups.

### Removing channels vs removing timepoints
Sometimes it's obvious that a channel is bad. More often, a channel is sometimes bad, and sometimes fine.

## What's noise and what's signal

#### Clean Data
![](./images/CleanData1.PNG)
This data is 60 seconds of EEG across 128 channels, according to the following labels:

#### Eyes open
![](./images/Biocalibration/EO.PNG)
> Bad channels have not been removed yet

#### Eyex closed
![](./images/Biocalibration/EC.PNG)
The circled area shows the artifect of eyes being closed. This will be removed with ICA. The central channels in the pannel are occipital channels, where alpha activity increases once eyes are closed (Berger Effect).


#### Blinks
![](./images/Biocalibration/blink.PNG)
This is a participant blinking once per second. All eye movements get nicely removed with ICA. 


#### Muscle & movement
![](./images/Biocalibration/Jaw&Eyes.PNG)
The thick dark band affecting almost all channels is muscle activity. This is a very prominent example, but it often occurs in smaller bursts, and in fewer channels. This can either be removed with intense filtering (LP <15Hz), which is suboptimal, or if it's localized in time like this, cut out that segment of data. Likewise if there's a couple of channels that show the same high-frequency activity all the time (because electrode was placed on a muscle), this channel should be removed.

The large sharp spikes in frontal channels (top band) is due to movement of the skin around the eyes shifting under the electrode. This is also what it looks like when the participants scratches the net, or similar. There's no filtering that away, it needs to be cut out.
