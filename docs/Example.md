### Example Intro
We just love the **2-process model** by *Alexander Borberly*:
![](images/intro/2processmodel.png)

I'm not going to bother explaining it, so just look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep).

If you can't do something fancy in Markdown, you can just write in HTML: <a href="http://google.com/" target="_blank">Just Google It!</a>

But! What if someone here already presents it? Well I can just link it like [so](https://hubersleeplab.github.io/README2.html).
In case you didn't notice, there's a cute little menu on the left, but it will only write up to three `###` pound signs.

#### Subpoint to the intro
- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

#### Example Code
```m
Var1 = 3;
Var2 = 5;

Result = Var1*Var2;
```


Now just replace the numbers in `Var1` and you can do math!

### Example data

If you're really fancy, you can add a table:

Row Names | Data
----------|----- 
First row | Lots of data
Second row | More data

```m

A = 3;
B = [1 2 3];
F = plot(B,A);

close all
```

The m makes it matlab colored
